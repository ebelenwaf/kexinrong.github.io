  I am a third year Ph.D student in Computer Science at Stanford University, co-advised by Prof. <a href="http://www.bailis.org/">Peter Bailis</a> and Prof. <a href="http://csl.stanford.edu/~pal/">Philip Levis.</a>
  I am a member of the <a href="http://dawn.cs.stanford.edu/"> Stanford DAWN</a> project, and the <a href="http://iot.stanford.edu/">Secure Internet of Things Project</a>. I am broadly interested in efficient and effective data analytics for large-scale, machine generated data. My recent projects include automatic smoothing parameter selection for time series visualization and earthquake detection through computationally efficient time series similarity search.
