  I am a member of the <a href="http://dawn.cs.stanford.edu/"> Stanford DAWN</a> project, and the <a href="http://iot.stanford.edu/">Secure Internet of Things Project</a>. I am broadly interested in efficient and effective data analytics for large-scale, machine generated data. My recent projects include automatic smoothing parameter selection for time series visualization and earthquake detection through computationally efficient time series similarity search.  </p>
 <p>I graduated from Caltech in 2015 with a B.S. in Computer Science. Before that, I attended Nanjing Foreign Language School in Nanjing, China.</p>
